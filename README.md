# Predict-the-Feature-of-Functions

This is a test project mainly use masked language modeling, to capture the inherent patterns and dependencies between function signatures and function assembly code. Subsequently, the project will fine-tune the pretrained model on specific downstream tasks related to function signature prediction.
